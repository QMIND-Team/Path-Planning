Altered Files:

turtlebot3/turtlebot3_dqn/nodes/moving_obstacle.py
	- changed obstacle movement for stage 5
turtlebot3_simulations/turtlebot3_gazebo/models/turtlebot3_square/model.sdf
	- Changed the world dimensions
turtlebot3/turtlebot3_dqn/nodes/turtlebot3_dqn_stage_#.py
	- Added epFlag
	- Removed if dones
	- Removed target network
	- Removed inputs so it was only lidar data
turtlebot3/turtlebot3_dqn/src/turtlebot3_dqn/environment_stage_#.py
	- Changed reward system drastically
	- Removed the unwanted inputs from the getState function (as we changed the model and no longer need them)
	- Restrcuted for new arena size

Parameters:

- In turtlebot3_dqn_stage_# (found in /turtlebot3/turtlebot3_dqn/nodes):
	- load_model: whether or not to load a previous model
	- epFlag: If loading model, whether or not to use stored epsilon model (True means use models, False means use parameter defined below)
	- load_episode: If loading model, what eppisode you are loading. If not, set as 0
	- epsilon: probability of random movement during training
	- epsilon_decay: rate of lowering epsilon value
	- epsilon_min: minimum epsilon value

How to run:

- Open terminal and run "roscore"
- Open second terminal and run "roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_stage_#.launch" # = stage number
- Open third terminal and run "roslaunch turtlebot3_dqn turtlebot3_dqn_stage_#.launch" # = stage number
